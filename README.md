# SQLite Chat Assistant

A Python-based chat assistant that interacts with an SQLite database to answer natural language queries about employees and departments.

## How It Works

### Components
1. **Natural Language Processing**:  
   Uses regex patterns to convert natural language queries into SQL commands.  
   Supported query patterns include:
   - Department employee listings
   - Department manager identification
   - Employee hire date filtering
   - Department salary totals

2. **Database Structure**:  
   SQLite database with 2 tables:
   ```sql
   Employees (ID, Name, Department, Salary, Hire_Date)
   Departments (ID, Name, Manager)
Web Interface:
Built with Flask, featuring:

Real-time chat-like interface

Tabular results display

Error message handling

Query Processing:

Converts user input to SQL queries

Executes against database

Returns formatted JSON responses

Local Installation
Requirements
Python 3.7+

Flask

SQLite3

Setup Steps

Install Dependencies


pip install -r requirements.txt
Initialize Database


python database/create_db.py
Start Application


python app.py
Access Interface

"Who is the manager of the Engineering department?"

"List all employees hired after 2021-01-01"

"What is the total salary expense for the Marketing department?"

Limitations
Current Constraints
Query Patterns
Limited to 4 predefined question formats

Date Handling
Requires exact YYYY-MM-DD format

Error Messages
Basic error reporting without detailed explanations

UI Features

No chat history persistence

Basic text formatting

No user authentication

Suggested Improvements
Enhanced NLP
Integrate lightweight NLP library (e.g., spaCy) for better query understanding

Query Expansion
Add support for:

Employee search by name

Salary range queries

Department performance metrics

Security

Add SQL injection protection

Implement rate limiting

UI Enhancements

Chat history storage

Export results to CSV/PDF

Interactive query builder

Database

Add data validation constraints

Implement proper indexing

Add audit logging
